# Examples

Every example is a standalone `main` package under [`examples/`](https://github.com/mrlm-net/simconnect/tree/main/examples). Run one from the repository root with `go run ./examples/<name>` while the simulator is running.

Start with the airport map. It uses most of the SDK at once, shows what the simulator reports, and is the tool the SDK itself is debugged with.

## The airport map

![The airport map at LKPR](images/airport-map/ui-traffic-light.png)

[`cmd/airport-map`](https://github.com/mrlm-net/simconnect/tree/main/cmd/airport-map) serves a live map of an airport on <http://127.0.0.1:8080>. It shows:

- **The ground layout** as SimConnect reports it: runways, taxi paths by `TYPE`, taxi points, hold-short points, taxiway names and parking stands. Every feature's popup shows its raw facility index and field values, so the taxi graph can be checked against the data ([Airport Layout](airport-layout.md)).
- **Taxi routing:** click a stand and pick a runway to see the departure route, its taxiways and runway crossings, or the taxi-in from a runway exit.
- **AI traffic under your control:** spawn departures and arrivals and give their clearances: pushback, taxi, progressive taxi, runway crossings, line-up, take-off ([Traffic Commands](traffic-commands.md)).
- **Scheduled traffic:** airlines fly a timetable at the airport by themselves, with departure and arrival boards, en route arrivals and overflights ([Traffic Schedules](traffic-schedules.md), [Traffic Manager](traffic-manager.md)).
- **The landing sequence and the tower:** landing order and spacing per runway, delays absorbed by speed, path stretching and holds, go-arounds, and a tower that clears line-up, take-off and crossings ([Airborne Separation](traffic-separation.md)).
- **Conflicts:** airborne pairs predicted to come within 5 NM and 1000 ft, and the change given to resolve each.
- **The ATC game:** work ground and tower yourself, scored ([ATC Game](atc-game.md)).

### Run it

```bash
# Live: connect to the simulator and open LKPR
cd cmd/airport-map && go run .

# Another airport
cd cmd/airport-map && go run . -icao LOWW

# Also save each fetched airport's raw data to <ICAO>.json
cd cmd/airport-map && go run . -dump

# Offline: serve a saved dump, no simulator needed (layout and routes only)
cd cmd/airport-map && go run . -file LKPR.json
```

Open <http://127.0.0.1:8080/?icao=LKPR>. Click the airport at the top left and type another ICAO code to load it; **↻** fetches it again from the simulator.

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `-addr` | `127.0.0.1:8080` | HTTP listen address |
| `-icao` | `LKPR` | Airport opened on start |
| `-dump` | `false` | Write each fetched airport's raw facility records to `<ICAO>.json` |
| `-dump-dir` | `.` | Directory for `-dump` files |
| `-file` | | Serve a `-dump` file instead of connecting to the simulator |
| `-log-dir` | `.` | Directory for the traffic control log, `traffic-<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>.log` |
| `-airways` | `pkg/nav/testdata/LKPR-airways.json` | Airway graph for flight plans (see `spike-airways`); `""` for direct routes |

The page loads Leaflet from cdnjs, the IBM Plex fonts from Google Fonts and map tiles from Esri and OpenStreetMap, so the browser needs internet access.

### A tour

The interface has three layers: a **status strip** across the top, the **selected aircraft** in its own panel, and the **sections** at the side (a bottom sheet on a phone). Light, dark or the system's theme is picked at the top right.

![The airport map at LKPR: the status strip, a departure selected, the traffic list](images/airport-map/ui-traffic.png)

The **status strip** shows:

- the airport and the runway in use;
- the ATIS letter, the wind and the QNH;
- Pause and the simulation rate;
- the game score;
- the camera;
- the frequency you listen to;
- the position this device works (**As**, for network play);
- the connection.

**The selected aircraft** (click it on the map or in a list) shows:

- its state and how long it has waited;
- the next clearance as one big button. Pushback has its facing (N, E, S, W) and "with start-up" by it.
- the other clearances by phase;
- Hold position, Go around and Abort take-off, always in the same place;
- its route, procedure, frequency, motion and lights;
- its last calls on the radio;
- Show, Follow, Camera, Manual, Rush and Remove.

Click a point of its route on the map to clear it up to there. The first clearance you give an aircraft makes it **Manual**: from then on you give all its clearances. **Manual** off hands it back to ATC automation.

**Traffic** lists the aircraft waiting for you (oldest first), the ones moving, and those airborne or done. **New flight** spawns one aircraft:

1. Pick the kind, click a stand (or *Free stand*), and pick the runway with an entry or exit. The route is previewed on the map.
2. Optionally set a flight plan, the model and livery, the call sign, a tug, the procedures, a turnaround, de-icing, or a custom taxi route.
3. **Spawn** says what it will do.

The traffic log has every clearance as said.

**Sequence** has:

- the landing sequence per runway: call sign, wake category, distance to go, delay, and what the aircraft is doing;
- controls to move an arrival up or down, send it direct to the final, slow it, hold it or send it around;
- a ladder of the final, with the gaps green when kept and red when short;
- the tower (who is at each runway, and what they wait for) and the predicted conflicts.

![The landing sequence and the final ladder](images/airport-map/ui-sequence.png)

**Schedule** runs the timetable at the airport. It has the departure, arrival and overflight boards, and the [ATC game](atc-game.md).

**Radio** lists the airport's frequencies with the aircraft on each, and the conversation on the one followed. The voice can play:

- on the map's computer, on the output picked;
- on the device you are using (**Play on this device**).

**Follow my COM1** and **Tune my COM1** link the radio to your aircraft.

![The radio: frequencies and the conversation](images/airport-map/ui-radio.png)

**Airport** has:

- the runway in use, the weather and the ATIS (Listen reads it out);
- the SIDs, STARs and approaches of a runway, drawn on the map;
- the de-icing pads.

![Airport: runway in use, weather and ATIS](images/airport-map/ui-airport.png)

**Map** has:

- the base map;
- the layers: our aircraft, other traffic, safe zones, the final, taxiway names, overlapping and occupied stands, and taxi paths and points by `TYPE`;
- the traffic picture's centre and radius, and the world view.

On a phone the sections are a bottom sheet over the full-screen map:

![On a phone](images/airport-map/ui-phone.png)

The map's [README](https://github.com/mrlm-net/simconnect/tree/main/cmd/airport-map) covers network play (`-addr :8080`, one position per device) and lists the HTTP API, which scripts and tests can use too. The previous interface is at `/classic` while the new one settles.
