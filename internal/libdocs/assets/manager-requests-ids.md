# Manager Request and ID Management

This document explains how the manager package handles SimConnect requests and ID allocation to prevent conflicts and enable request tracking.

## ID Allocation Strategy

The manager uses a **high-number ID reservation strategy** to maximize flexibility for user applications:

### ID Ranges

| Range | Owner | Count | Purpose |
|-------|-------|-------|---------|
| 1 - 999,999,849 | **User Applications** | 999,999,849 | User-defined data definitions and requests |
| 999,999,850 - 999,999,886 | **Manager** | 37 | Custom system event IDs (dynamic allocation) |
| 999,999,887 - 999,999,899 | **Reserved** | 13 | Unallocated buffer for future use |
| 999,999,900 - 999,999,999 | **Manager** | 100 | Internal manager operations (reserved) |

### Why High Numbers for Manager?

1. **User-Friendly**: Allows applications to use IDs starting from 1 without conflict
2. **Defensive**: High numbers are unlikely to be chosen by developers
3. **Clear Boundaries**: Easy to identify and validate ID ownership
4. **Scalable**: Provides >999M IDs for user applications

## Current Manager IDs

### Simulator State System

```go
CameraDefinitionID = 999999900  // Camera/simulator state data definition
CameraRequestID    = 999999901  // Periodic camera state data polling
```

**Purpose**: Continuously polls simulator state (camera, simulation, environment, aircraft telemetry) to update the manager's `SimState`.

**Usage**: Internal to the manager. Not directly accessible to users but affects `OnSimStateChange` notifications.

The manager's simulator state data definition now includes additional environment, simulation, and aircraft telemetry variables which are exposed on `SimState`:

- `SIMULATION RATE` (Number) — internal rate of passing time
- `SIMULATION TIME` (Seconds) — seconds since the simulation started
- `LOCAL TIME` (Seconds) — seconds since local midnight
- `ZULU TIME` (Seconds) — seconds since Zulu (UTC) midnight
- `LOCAL DAY OF MONTH`, `LOCAL MONTH OF YEAR`, `LOCAL YEAR` (Number) — local date
- `ZULU DAY OF MONTH`, `ZULU MONTH OF YEAR`, `ZULU YEAR` (Number) — Zulu date
- `IS IN VR`, `IS USING MOTION CONTROLLERS`, `IS USING JOYSTICK THROTTLE`, `IS IN RTC`, `IS AVATAR`, `IS AIRCRAFT` (Boolean) — environment flags
- `AMBIENT TEMPERATURE` (Celsius), `AMBIENT PRESSURE` (inHg), `AMBIENT WIND VELOCITY` (Knots)
- `AMBIENT WIND DIRECTION` (Degrees), `AMBIENT VISIBILITY` (Meters), `AMBIENT IN CLOUD` (Boolean)
- `AMBIENT PRECIP STATE` (Mask), `BAROMETER PRESSURE` (Millibars), `SEA LEVEL PRESSURE` (Millibars)
- `GROUND ALTITUDE` (Feet), `MAGVAR` (Degrees), `SURFACE TYPE` (Enum)
- `PLANE LATITUDE` (Degrees), `PLANE LONGITUDE` (Degrees), `PLANE ALTITUDE` (Feet), `INDICATED ALTITUDE` (Feet)
- `PLANE HEADING DEGREES TRUE` (Degrees), `PLANE HEADING DEGREES MAGNETIC` (Degrees)
- `PLANE PITCH DEGREES` (Degrees), `PLANE BANK DEGREES` (Degrees)
- `GROUND VELOCITY` (Knots), `AIRSPEED INDICATED` (Knots), `AIRSPEED TRUE` (Knots), `VERTICAL SPEED` (Feet per minute)
- `SMART CAMERA ACTIVE` (Boolean)
- `HAND ANIM STATE` (Number, 0-12 frame IDs), `HIDE AVATAR IN AIRCRAFT` (Boolean), `MISSION SCORE` (Number), `PARACHUTE OPEN` (Boolean)
- `ZULU SUNRISE TIME` (Seconds), `ZULU SUNSET TIME` (Seconds), `TIME ZONE OFFSET` (Seconds)
- `TOOLTIP UNITS` (Enum: 0=Default, 1=Metric, 2=US), `UNITS OF MEASURE` (Enum: 0=English, 1=Metric/feet, 2=Metric/meters)
- `AMBIENT IN SMOKE` (Boolean), `ENV SMOKE DENSITY` (Percent), `ENV CLOUD DENSITY` (Percent)
- `DENSITY ALTITUDE` (Feet), `SEA LEVEL AMBIENT TEMPERATURE` (Celsius)

### Event System (manager-reserved IDs)

The manager reserves specific high-number IDs for internal system event subscriptions. These are registered on connection open and used for request tracking; the actual SimConnect system event names are standard (e.g. "Pause", "Sim", "FlightLoaded").

```go
PauseEventID                 = 999999998 // Pause/unpause event subscription
SimEventID                   = 999999997 // Sim start/stop event subscription
FlightLoadedEventID          = 999999996 // Flight file loaded (filename returned)
AircraftLoadedEventID        = 999999995 // Aircraft file loaded/changed (.AIR)
ObjectAddedEventID           = 999999994 // AI object added
ObjectRemovedEventID         = 999999993 // AI object removed
FlightPlanActivatedEventID   = 999999992 // Flight plan activated (filename returned)
CrashedEventID               = 999999991 // Simulator crashed (manager reserved ID)
CrashResetEventID            = 999999990 // Crash reset event (manager reserved ID)
SoundEventID                 = 999999989 // Sound event (manager reserved ID)
ViewEventID                  = 999999988 // View camera event (manager reserved ID)
FlightPlanDeactivatedEventID = 999999987 // Flight plan deactivated
```

**Purpose**: These IDs are used to register and track the manager's internal subscriptions to SimConnect system events. Responses may arrive as different `SIMCONNECT_RECV` variants (e.g., `SIMCONNECT_RECV_EVENT`, `SIMCONNECT_RECV_EVENT_FILENAME`, `SIMCONNECT_RECV_EVENT_OBJECT_ADDREMOVE`).

**Usage**: Internal to the manager. The manager updates `SimState` for Pause/Sim events and provides typed subscription helpers for filename/object events.

### Custom Event System (manager-reserved ID range)

The manager reserves a range of IDs for user-defined custom system events:

```go
CustomEventIDMin = 999999850 // First ID for custom events
CustomEventIDMax = 999999886 // Last ID for custom events (37 slots total)
```

**Purpose**: These IDs are dynamically allocated when users subscribe to custom SimConnect system events by name (e.g., "6Hz", "1sec"). Custom events use the `SubscribeToCustomSystemEvent` and `OnCustomSystemEvent` APIs.

**Usage**: Managed internally by the manager. Custom event subscriptions are automatically cleared on disconnect and are not persisted across reconnection cycles.

## Request Registry

The manager maintains a `RequestRegistry` that tracks all active SimConnect requests. This enables:

- **Request Correlation**: Match responses to the original requests
- **Diagnostics**: View all outstanding requests at any time
- **Conflict Detection**: Validate user IDs before use
- **Cleanup**: Release resources when requests complete

### RequestRegistry API

```go
// Create a registry
registry := NewRequestRegistry()

// Register a request when making a SimConnect call
info := registry.Register(1000, RequestTypeDataDefinition, "My Data Definition")

// Optionally add custom context for tracking
info.Context["purpose"] = "tracking_aircraft"

// Later, check if a response matches a known request
if info, exists := registry.Get(1000); exists {
    // Response is valid for request ID 1000
    purpose := info.Context["purpose"]
}

// When request completes, unregister it
registry.Unregister(1000)

// Check all outstanding requests
pending := registry.GetAll()
fmt.Printf("Outstanding requests: %d\n", registry.Count())

// Clear on disconnect
registry.Clear()
```

### RequestType Constants

```go
RequestTypeDataDefinition  // AddToDataDefinition, ClearDataDefinition
RequestTypeDataRequest     // RequestDataOnSimObject, RequestDataOnSimObjectType
RequestTypeDataSet         // SetDataOnSimObject
RequestTypeEvent           // SubscribeToSystemEvent, UnsubscribeFromSystemEvent
RequestTypeObject          // RequestSimulatorState, RequestFacilities, etc.
RequestTypeCustom          // User-defined or other request types
```

## Best Practices for Users

### 1. Choose Your ID Range

Pick a sub-range within 1-999,999,899 for your application:

```go
const (
    // Aircraft data definitions
    AircraftPositionDef = 1000
    AircraftVelocityDef = 1001
    
    // Environment data definitions
    WeatherDataDef = 2000
    WindDataDef    = 2001
)
```

### 2. Validate Before Use

Use the provided validation functions:

```go
if !manager.IsValidUserID(myID) {
    return fmt.Errorf("invalid user ID: %d (reserved for manager)", myID)
}
```

### 3. Document Your ID Assignments

Keep a clear mapping of your IDs:

```go
// MyApp IDs
// 1000-1099: Aircraft data
// 2000-2099: Environment data
// 3000-3099: Traffic data
```

### 4. Use the Request Registry (Optional)

If you need to track user-initiated requests, access the manager's registry via the `Client()` method:

```go
client := manager.Client()
// Note: Current implementation doesn't expose registry to users
// This is a future enhancement point
```

## ID Validation Helpers

The manager provides utility functions to validate IDs:

```go
// Check if an ID is reserved for manager use
if manager.IsManagerID(999100) {
    fmt.Println("This ID is reserved for the manager")
}

// Check if an ID is within the user range
if manager.IsValidUserID(1000) {
    fmt.Println("This ID is available for user requests")
}
```

## Conflict Resolution

If your application accidentally uses a manager-reserved ID:

1. **On Connection**: The manager will register its internal requests (999999900, 999999901, 999999998)
2. **Potential Conflict**: If you use the same ID, your definition will be overwritten
3. **Detection**: Check the manager logs or use `IsManagerID()` in validation

**Prevention**: Always validate your IDs against the manager's reserved range before use.

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for request management:

1. **User Request Tracking**: Expose registry interface to users for tracking custom requests
2. **ID Allocation Pool**: Automatic ID assignment for user requests
3. **Request Timeout Handling**: Automatic cleanup of abandoned requests
4. **Exception Correlation**: Link failed requests to exception messages
5. **Configurable Manager Range**: Allow users to specify different ID ranges for the manager

## Internal Implementation Details

### Registration Points

Manager registers internal requests at these points:

1. **On Connection (via `onEngineOpen`)**:
    - Simulator State Definition (999999900) — registers camera state, simulation/time variables, date fields, IS_* flags, environment SimVars, aircraft telemetry, and extended variables
    - Simulator State Request (999999901)
    - Pause Event (999999998)
    - Crashed/CrashReset/Sound event subscriptions (manager reserved IDs listed above)

2. **On Disconnect (via `disconnect`)**:
   - All requests cleared via `requestRegistry.Clear()`

### Request Types Used by Manager

- `RequestTypeEvent`: Pause event subscription
- `RequestTypeDataDefinition`: Camera state definition
- `RequestTypeDataRequest`: Camera state periodic request

### Cleanup Strategy

When the connection closes or manager stops:
1. Unsubscribe from pause events
2. Clear simulator state data definition
3. Clear all entries in request registry
4. Reset `simStateDataRequestPending` flag

This ensures a clean state for the next connection.
